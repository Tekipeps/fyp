In this chapter, the review of literature relevant to the study area of the heart disease prediction using machine learning techniques is carried out and one of the major focuses is to explain the history and empirical basis of this study.

\section{Heart disease}
Heart disease is a term used to represent a variety of illnesses or conditions that affect the heart, including coronary artery disease, heart rhythm issues (arrhythmias), hereditary defects (congenital heart defects), heart valve disease, diseases of the heart muscle, and infections of the heart. Heart disease can be caused by things like underlying health problems, contamination, irritation, and family history. To help prevent cardiovascular disease, you should live a healthy lifestyle and stay away from smoking, food that makes you fat, and stress. Heart disease is a serious problem in many countries around the world.

\subsection{Typical heart problems}

The factors that cause the heart to break down include any major abnormal heart or blood vessel condition known as coronary disease. The different sorts of heart disease are:

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
	\item{Coronary Artery Disease: refers to arrangement of cholesterol plaque which causes solidifying or restricting of the heart channel, (which supplies blood to the heart).}
	\item{Cardiomyopathy: refers to a disease of the heart muscle that makes it harder for the heart to pump blood to the rest of the body.}
	\item{Angina: a type of chest pain caused by reduced blood flow to the heart.}
	\item{Valvular Heart Disease: refers to damage or decease on at least one of the four valves of the heart.}
	\item{Congenital Heart Disease: refers to a variety of birth defects that affect the normal functioning of the heart.}
	\item{Heart attack: A heart attack occurs when an artery carrying blood and oxygen to the heart becomes blocked.}
	\item {Heart failure: Heart failure occurs when the heart muscle fails to adequately pump blood. This does not mean the heart has stopped beating. }
	\item{Arrhythmia: An alteration in the heart's electrical impulse sequence that can cause irregular or fast (tachycardia) or slow (bradycardia) heartbeats. }
	\item{Rheumatic Heart Disease: a condition where the heart muscles and valves are permanently damaged due to rheumatic fever.}
	
	\item{Ischemic Heart Disease (IHD): is the term given to heart problems caused by narrowed heart arteries.}
	
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Symptoms of heart disease}
The above-mentioned heart diseases are only a few of the many heart diseases that affect both men and women. These can be detected by paying close attention to the common factors that cause heart disease. The following are some of the most prevalent symptoms of heart disease:

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
	\item{Having pain in the upper body such as the arms, jaw, neck, back or upper stomach.}
	\item{Significant strain, discomfort, or a burning pain in the chest.}
	\item{Rapidly expanding heartbeat.}
	\item{Unsteadiness, sweating and nausea.}
	\item{Swelling, anxiety, cough, aching, burning and so on...}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Cure of heart disease}
According to \citefullauthor{Clinic2022Can}, unfortunately, there is no cure for coronary heart disease, and once recognized, the illness cannot be reversed. However, one can make lifestyle adjustments to minimize their chances of having other health issues, such as a heart attack.

\section{Machine Learning}
Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence that is focused on making systems that can learn from their experiences and make predictions based on what they have learned. It uses a training dataset to teach machine learning algorithms so that a model can be made. With the new information, the model can predict heart disease. Using machine learning, it looks for hidden patterns in the input dataset to build models. It can accurately predict what will happen with new data sets. The data set is cleaned up, and values that are missing are added. The model uses the new data to make predictions about heart disease, which are then tested to see how well they work. 

\subsection{Techniques for machine learning}
Techniques for machine learning can be grouped into supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning.

\subsubsection{Supervised learning}
The model is trained on a labelled data set. The dataset contains the inputs and an outcome. Data are sorted and separated into training datasets and test datasets. Training dataset is used to train our model, and testing dataset is used as new data to test how well the model works. 
A good example of this is the classification and regression.
\subsubsection{Unsupervised learning}
The data set does not contain any classed or labelled data used for training. The objective is to uncover patterns within the data. The model has been taught to create patterns. It can quickly identify hidden patterns in every new input dataset, but after further data exploration, it uses the datasets to derive conclusions about hidden patterns.
With this method, the dataset has no responses. An example of an unsupervised learning method is the clustering approach.
\subsubsection{Reinforcement learning}
In this method, the model refines its presentation based on its association with the environment. It doesn't use labelled datasets, and neither the results nor the data are linked to the datasets. Instead, the model learns from what it does. It also determines how to disclose its flaws and how to attain the desired conclusion by assessing and testing a variety of potential outcomes.
Classification algorithms are a popular type of supervised learning technique that are used to determine the likelihood of an individual having heart disease.


\subsection{Classification Machine Learning Techniques}
To classify something means to recognize it, comprehend it and place it in a set of categories that have already been established. Machine learning programs utilize several algorithms. Machine learning systems use multiple methods to classify new datasets based on previously classified training datasets. The following subsections discuss the algorithms used in this study.

\subsubsection{Logistic regression}
Classification algorithms, such as logistic regression, are supervised.
This statistical model is frequently employed in categorization and predictive analytics. Based on a collection of independent variables, logistic regression calculates the likelihood that a certain event will occur. 

As a result, the dependent variable is limited to a range of 0 to 1. 
Independent variables are analysed to determine the binary outcome with the results falling into one of two categories. The independent variables can be categorical or numeric, but the dependent variable is always categorical. Written like this: $$P(Y=1|X) or P(Y=0|X)$$
It calculates the probability of dependent variable Y, given independent variable X. 


\subsubsection{Naive Bayes}
Naïve Bayes  is a machine learning algorithm used to solve classification problems. Naïve Bayes is based on the Bayes Theorem and is one of the simplest yet powerful ML algorithms in use. It finds applications in many industries.

The Bayes' theorem is used by Naïve Bayes algorithm, which also assumes that each predictor is independent. To put it another way, this classifier makes the assumption that the presence of one specific feature in a class has no influence on the presence of another.

	\caption{Naive bayes}
	\label{fig:nb}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{K-nearest neighbours}
The K-nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithm is a form of supervised learning technique that can be used for regression as well as classification. KNN performs a distance calculation between the test data and all of the training points in an effort to determine which class the data being evaluated should be assigned to. The K number of points that should be selected is the one that comes closest to the test data. The KNN algorithm computes the chance that the test data belong to the same classes as the 'K' training data, and the class that retains the highest probability is the one that is chosen. In the case of regression, the value is determined by calculating the average of the 'K' training points that were chosen.

Say we have a picture of something that looks like both a cat and a dog, but we want to know if it's a cat or a dog. We can use the KNN method for this identification because it measures similarity. Our KNN model will look for similarities between the new data set and the images of cats and dogs. Based on the similarities it finds, it will put the new data set into either the cat or dog category.

	\centering
	\makebox[0cm]{\includegraphics[scale=0.45]{KNN.png}}
	\caption{K-nearest neighbours}
	\label{fig:knn}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Decision Tree}
A decision tree is a non-parametric supervised learning algorithm that can be used for both classification and regression tasks. As a supervised learning technique, a decision tree is ideal for classifying issues at a precise level of detail. Like a flow chart, it takes data from the "tree trunk" and divides it into two related categories at a time: "branches" and "leaves." This allows for organic classification with minimal human oversight by creating categories within categories.
