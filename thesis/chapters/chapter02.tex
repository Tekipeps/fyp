\section{Gene, Genome and DNA}
A gene is the basic unit of heredity that occupies a specific position on a chromosome. Each is made up of nucleotides that are organized in a linear way. Most genes encode for a specific protein or protein portion that results in a certain feature or function. DNA is an organic material that carries genetic information as well as instructions for protein formation. A genome is an organism's complete set of genetic instructions. Each genome contains all of the information needed to build that organism and is made up of DNA (Deoxyribonucleic acid) or RNA(Ribonucleic acid).
