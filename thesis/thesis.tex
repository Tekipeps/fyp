\chapter*{DECLARATION}
\noindent
I admit that I did all the work on this project by myself and that it has never been turned in for credit toward a degree. The report is also all written in my own words, except for a few quotes that were properly credited and acknowledged. Miss Asegunoluwa Babalola was my supervisor in charge of supervising both the project work and the report.

\chapter*{ABSTRACT}
\noindent
Heart disease, often known as cardiovascular disease, encompasses a variety of disorders that affect the heart and has been the leading cause of mortality worldwide in recent years. Because of the many factors that can increase the likelihood of developing heart disease, it is essential to create efficient and effective methods of early identification. This study discusses four different machine learning models based on supervised learning techniques like naive bayes, decision tree, logistic regression and K-nearest neighbours. A web interface is built to provide users a way to interact with the model. The system also has an inference engine that provides a descriptive output and medical advice based on the input data.

Definition. An appendix contains supplementary material that is not an essential part of the text itself but which may be helpful in providing a more comprehensive understanding of the research problem or it is information that is too cumbersome to be included in the body of the paper.
