		Heart disease, often known as cardiovascular disease, encompasses a variety of disorders that affect the heart and has been the leading cause of mortality worldwide in recent years. It is associated with numerous risk factors in heart disease and a necessity of the time to obtain accurate, reliable, and sensible techniques to make an early diagnosis in order to achieve fast treatment strategies. In the health sector, data mining is a widely utilized technique for processing massive amounts of data. Researchers use a variety of data mining and machine learning approaches to analyze massive amounts of complex medical data, assisting healthcare providers in predicting heart disease. This study discusses many aspects of cardiac disease, as well as a model based on supervised learning techniques. Nave Bayes,1 decision tree, and K-nearest neighbor.

\comment {
Definition. An appendix contains supplementary material that is not an essential part of the text itself but which may be helpful in providing a more comprehensive understanding of the research problem or it is information that is too cumbersome to be included in the body of the paper.
